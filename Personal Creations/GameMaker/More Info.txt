In The End, Everyone Dies:
This is just a simple survival game which I was working on. It is unfinished.
I was struggling with doing the art myself which is the main reason why I lost interest and stopped working on it.
Its probably the furthest along out of any games I have worked on since I added a lot of art and music.
My other games are more for exploring ideas and concept.
