Ascii-Heroes:
I made this game in my first year of university before I had learnt much about C#.
The main reason for this game was to try and create a game which could run entirely in the C# console.
I am pretty happy with how it turned out considering I was still learning C# at the time.

CS-Walk-A-Thon-App:
This was a website which I worked on for my 3rd year project. Unfortunately, due to special circumstances during that year, we
were unable to choose our own topic for our project and were stuck selecting from about 4 topics which were pretty boring.
The website itself is meant to be a distance logger to basically see how long it would take a person to walk various routes
just using their daily distances.
I worked on the main dashboard and the actual distance logger page and I am pretty happy with my work however
the other sections were a little weird since the other members of my group were not good at working with proper
deadlines and also didn't know how to use Git properly preventing me from helping them.
